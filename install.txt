(This is short. For further information see http://docs.python.org/install/)

Start a command line and change to this directory.

Then:

1) Using pip (recommended):

    pip install . [--user]
    
   
2) Without pip:

    python setup.py install [--user]



Use the `--user` flag if you want to install it for your user only and 
your python installation is system-wide.
